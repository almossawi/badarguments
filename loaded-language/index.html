      <p>I’m thrilled that the <a href='https://bookofbadarguments.com/extras/guide-to-sneaky-rhetoric'>project I shared with you all</a> late last year will be out in print <b>this October</b>. It will look absolutely stunning, with 13+ original illustrations and a gorgeous cover by the always outstanding <a href='https://alejogiraldo.com/'>Alejandro Giraldo</a>.</p>
      <!--<p>The book will have seven chapters, touching on the different and often subtle ways headlines and various other forms of language influence our thinking.</p>-->
      <p>Transforming the working draft to a hardcover couldn't have been done by a better team. The project is in excellent hands. I’ll be sharing updates and photos on <a href='https://www.instagram.com/almossawi/'>Instagram</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/alialmossawi'>Twitter</a> as we get closer to release&nbsp;day.
