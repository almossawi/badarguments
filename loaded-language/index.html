    <meta property="og:description" content="In this adorably illustrated book, old Mr. Rabbit is your guide to these and many more examples of loaded language. He mines real reporting (by respected and rogue media alike) to unmask rhetoric that shifts blame, erases responsibility, dog-whistles, plays on fear, or rewrites history—subtly or shamelessly. It takes a long pair of ears to hear what’s left unsaid—but when the very notion of truth is at stake, listening for “spin” makes all the difference." />

      <p>LOADED LANGUAGE — I’m thrilled that the <a href='https://bookofbadarguments.com/extras/guide-to-sneaky-rhetoric'>project I shared with you all</a> late last year will be out in print <b>this October</b>. It will look absolutely stunning, with 13+ original illustrations and a gorgeous cover by the always outstanding <a href='https://alejogiraldo.com/'>Alejandro Giraldo.</a></p>
      <p>It will have seven chapters, touching on the different, and often subtle, ways in which headlines and various other forms of language influence our thinking.</p>
      <p>The book has a new title, you might have noticed. It couldn’t be in better hands, quite honestly. I’ll be sharing updates and photos on <a href='https://www.instagram.com/almossawi/'>Instagram</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/alialmossawi'>Twitter</a> as we get closer to release&nbsp;day.

      <h2 class='text-center'>A Note About the Price</h2>
      <p>The print edition is published by a small press I've set up in San Francisco called <a href='https://almossawi.com/cormorantpress'>Cormorant Press</a>. If we sell out the first print, the book will come close to breaking even, but not quite. $18.99 was my hard limit for the book's list price. I'm betting on future prints, non-Amazon fulfillments, and ebook sales to help the project become cash flow positive.</p>
