    <p class='no-indent'><b>Misattributing quotes</b> is a related tactic with a different outcome: Crediting one person’s words to an entire group leaves less room for doubt. This can often be hard to spot. For instance, a line in <i>The Guardian</i> reads:</p>

    <p><i><b>Witnesses</b> at the scene said that there was a “tremendous bang and then all hell broke loose.”</i><sup>3</sup> Adding an <i>-es</i> transforms one person’s account to a unanimous report.</p>
    <p>A CNN headline for what was deemed a bombshell article during a political contest reads:</p>
    <p><i>Mr. Badger Told Rabbit in Private Meeting That a Rabbit Would Never Win, Sources Say.</i> Specifically, four sources are cited. Later in the article, we find a line revealing that none of the four witnesses had firsthand knowledge of the meeting:</p>
    <p><i>The description of that meeting is based on the accounts of four people: two people Rabbit spoke with directly soon after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting.</i></p>
    <p>Thus might one eyewitness account, repeated to several, become a crowd of <i>sources</i>.</p>
