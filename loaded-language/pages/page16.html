    <p><i>I’d <b>found myself</b> planning the most divisive presidential inauguration in American history.</i> It’s the worst, isn’t it? When you’re sitting around, minding your own business, and then you <i>find yourself</i> planning an inauguration.</p>
    <p>Examples like these crop up all the time:</p>
    <p><i>Tower Housing [News Media] <b>Collapses</b> after Missile Strike.</i></p>
    <p><i>Upper Rabbitton Teen Wounded by Badger Gunfire <b>Dies</b>.</i></p>
    <p><i>Four Badger Guards Fired after a Rabbit <b>Dies</b> in . . . Custody.</i></p>
    <p><i>Hiroshima marks 75th anniversary of world’s first atomic bombing.</i></p>
    <p><i>Violent protests leave dozens dead.</i></p>
    <p><i>Rabbits zapped three badgers in an ambush last night; the event happened hours after six rabbits in a neighboring town <b>lost</b> their lives.</i></p>
    <p>A journalist might choose such phrases more to help “take the edge off” unpleasant news than to intentionally dilute accountability. But let the reader beware media where the “slant” always goes one way—as in the last example, which attributes an action to rabbits in the first part, but not to badgers in the second part.</p>
