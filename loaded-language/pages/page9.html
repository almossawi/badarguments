<h1>A Quick Introduction</h1>
<p class='capital'>Oh hello! Mr. Rabbit here. I’m pleased to meet you. You might be wondering how I’ve reached this, ahem, honorable old age. I’ll tell you: Careful listening is essential for a rabbit—and today, sneaky language is more prevalent than ever. It’s prevalent in everyday conversations, in newspapers and websites of record, in posts shared by influential people,
and in speeches by eloquent intellectuals. It colors how we perceive our world. You’re holding a compendium of this kind of rhetoric—not only what’s said out loud, but also what’s left unsaid.</p>
<p>One reason rhetorical sleight of hand gets past us is that, when listening to someone speak, we tend to focus on whether we <i>like</i> that person rather than whether they are making any sense. Another reason is
that our brains, by nature, process information differently based on context. We’re susceptible to how information is packaged and presented to us. Cognitive bias—and social bias—creeps in.</p>
