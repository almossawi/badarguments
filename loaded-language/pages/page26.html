    <p><i>Closer to home, Austria is today seeing its earliest snowfall in history with 30 to 40 centimetres already predicted in the mountains. Such dramatic falls in temperatures provide superficial evidence for those who doubt that the world is threatened by climate change.</i><sup>5</sup> This glosses over scientists’ stance that the effects of (global) climate change on (local) weather will include hotter and colder extremes.

    <p><i>Studies reveal that wearing face masks can negatively affect the mind and body.</i> The author goes on to cite a scientific finding that face masks reduce the oxygen level between the mask and one’s mouth; the columnist then concludes that this reduces the oxygen level in the body, with some unspecified negative outcome. But this ignores other research showing that the body is able to compensate for such drops in oxygen&nbsp;intake.</p>
