    <p>Not all “loaded language” is intentionally devious: While some writers aim to mislead us, others may use it unwittingly—especially when implicit bias comes into play. When a journalist refers to a politician’s <i>fact-free rhetorical style</i> rather than his <i>lies</i>, she more likely seeks to entertain than to excuse. A good many of my examples are from sources generally considered to be neutral, unbiased, and nonpartisan. I try to lay any implicit bias bare.</p>
    <p>This guide is about the <i>words</i> used to talk about various issues, and not about the issues themselves. You humans have a divisive-enough political climate as it is; I don’t intend to contribute to it! To that end, I have adapted certain examples taken from real-world media to feature rabbits and badgers. A select few have been slightly embellished for comedic effect.</p>
    <p>Any connection between badgers and the wrongheaded side of things is purely coincidental.</p>
