  <h1>1. Language That Conceals with Vagueness</h1>

  <p class='capital' style='margin-top: 80px'>Vagueness is at the heart of insincere language; it clouds thinking and it muddies meaning. As Orwell writes about vague terms, “The person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.”<sup>2</sup></p>
  <p>Vague language is often used to dissociate someone (perhaps we ourselves?) from a contemptible act or bad memory. In a classic moral thought experiment, a runaway trolley will strike and kill five people—unless you flip a switch to divert it, in which case it will kill one person. All things being equal, the math is simple, but it feels more comfortable to cause harm <i>indirectly</i> than to take action (by flipping the switch) and become complicit. We see that same instinct at work with vague language. Let’s look at some examples.</p>
