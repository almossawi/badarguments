    <p><i><b>Mistakes were made</b>. We don’t tolerate human rights violations or torture.</i> The passive voice describes the bad thing; the active voice describes the good thing. We end up with a shifting of blame, a weaseling out of any sense of responsibility.</p>
    <p class='no-indent'>No one ever makes a mistake; mistakes are always made. No one ever commits a crime; crimes are always committed.</p>
    <p>A carrot producer responds to an allegation of mistreating an employee with:</p>
    <p><i>We have a responsibility to the rabbits mentioned and to our employees, and a fair investigation <b>will be conducted</b>.</i> This interesting use of the passive voice leaves ambiguous who will conduct the investigation. We assume the company will take action by looking into the complaint—but in fact, they haven’t committed to doing so.</p>
    <br />
    <p class='no-indent'><b>Omitting detail</b>. What’s left <i>unsaid</i> is as much a part of any narrative as what’s included. A government body may point to members of an underrepresented group in key positions, but leave out that other underrepresented groups are denied that same opportunity by law. An autocrat might have people “disappeared” from photographs and films to bring a narrative more in tune with the party line. Language that omits detail can do exactly the same thing.</p>
