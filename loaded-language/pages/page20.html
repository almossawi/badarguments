    <p>Reporting on a political party’s national convention, held to formally elect the party’s presidential candidate, NBC News tweeted:</p>
    <p><i>In one of the shortest speeches of the convention, the congresswoman <b>did not</b> endorse the presumptive nominee Jim Bo.</i> While the statement is factually accurate, it omits a crucial detail: Organizers asked the congresswoman to endorse the runner-up candidate to acknowledge his efforts. Far from committing an act of rebellion (as the tweet attempts to insinuate), she was following protocol. The broadcaster later issued a clarifying note.</p>
    <p>On the financial news website Barron’s, we find the headline:</p>
    <p><i>CEO Sold Shares Ahead of Stock Split.</i> Later in the article, we read that the sale was announced well in advance, as is always the case with executives selling shares. The headline makes it seem like insider trading instead.</p>
    <p>A piece in <i>The New York Times</i> opens with:</p>
    <p><i>In by far the largest protest yet here, <b>tens of thousands</b> of demonstrators packed the city’s streets on Friday.</i> A paragraph later, we read that the crowd “appeared to be twice as large as one on Tuesday that drew about 100,000 people.”</p>
